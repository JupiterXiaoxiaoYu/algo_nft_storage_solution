# Introduction

This script is for fetching the ipfs links which include cids.

Before running it, you need to config the settings.yaml, by replacing the public key with yours, which is the account/address that originally mint NFT that you wanna repin.

After fetching, a data file contains the asset name and ipfs links of NFT will be generated in the output folder, this data file will then be used as the data source of repinning your cids.
